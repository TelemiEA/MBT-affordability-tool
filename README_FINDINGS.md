# MBT Automation Investigation - Key Findings

## üîç **Investigation Results**

After extensive testing and debugging, here are the key findings about MBT automation:

### ‚ùå **Why The Automation Was Producing Incorrect Results**

1. **WRONG FIELDS FILLED**:
   - ‚ùå Was filling: `purchase`, `loan_amount`, `student_loans`
   - ‚úÖ Should fill: `income_amount_primary_applicant`, `self_employed_income_year_1_primary_applicant`

2. **HIDDEN INCOME FIELDS**:
   - The real income fields are HIDDEN until specific form sections are completed
   - 34 income-related fields found, but only 3 visible initially
   - Income fields become visible only after setting employment status and other prerequisites

3. **COMPLEX WORKFLOW**:
   - MBT uses a multi-step progressive form
   - Each section must be completed in order to unlock the next
   - Dynamic field visibility based on previous selections

### üéØ **Answers to Your Key Questions**

**Q1: Separate cases vs reusing one case?**
‚úÖ **Answer**: Create SEPARATE cases for each scenario
- Each "Create RESI Case" generates unique URL
- Confirmed different case IDs for each creation

**Q2: Are we inputting numbers in the right spaces?**
‚ùå **Answer**: NO - We were filling completely wrong fields
- Was filling property/loan fields instead of income fields
- Real income fields are hidden until form progression unlocks them

**Q3: Results verification?**
‚ùå **Answer**: Results were wrong because inputs were wrong
- Need to follow proper MBT workflow to access correct fields
- Must verify income fields are visible before filling

### üöÄ **Recommended Next Steps**

Given the complexity discovered, I recommend a **two-phase approach**:

## **Phase 1: Manual + Semi-Automated (Immediate)**

1. **Use current dashboard** with verified login capability
2. **Manual data entry** - Complete scenarios manually in MBT
3. **Automated data collection** - Use our tool to store and analyze results
4. **Dashboard reporting** - Continue using the professional web interface

## **Phase 2: Full Automation (Future)**

1. **Advanced form analysis** - Map complete MBT workflow
2. **Progressive form filling** - Handle dynamic field visibility
3. **Validation testing** - Ensure correct field targeting
4. **Results verification** - Compare with manual completion

### üéØ **Current Tool Status**

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- MBT login authentication
- Professional web dashboard  
- Database storage and historical tracking
- Calculation engine (averages, differences, rankings)
- Multiple scenario support

‚ùå **What Needs Work:**
- Form field targeting (wrong fields identified)
- Dynamic form workflow handling
- Progressive section completion

### üí° **Immediate Workaround Solution**

1. **Keep using the dashboard** at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. **Login verification works** - proves MBT connectivity
3. **Manual input mode**: 
   - Complete scenarios manually in MBT
   - Enter results into our dashboard
   - Get automated analysis and benchmarking

### üîß **Technical Details for Future Development**

**Correct Field Names Identified:**
```
‚úÖ Real income fields (currently hidden):
- income_amount_primary_applicant
- self_employed_income_year_1_primary_applicant  
- self_employed_income_year_2_primary_applicant
- company_director_income_annual_remuneration_primary_applicant

‚ùå Wrong fields we were filling:
- purchase (property value)
- loan_amount (loan amount)
- student_loans (commitments)
```

**Form Progression Required:**
1. Basic applicant details
2. Mortgage preferences (reason for mortgage)
3. Property details
4. Personal demographics
5. Employment status (unlocks income fields)
6. Income details (now visible)
7. Financial commitments
8. Submit for results

### üéâ **Bottom Line**

Your instinct was correct - the results were wrong because we weren't filling the right fields. The investigation reveals MBT uses a complex progressive form that requires careful step-by-step completion.

**Current recommendation**: Use the tool for manual input and automated analysis while we develop the full automation properly.
