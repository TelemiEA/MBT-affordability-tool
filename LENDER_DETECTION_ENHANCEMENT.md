# 🔍 Enhanced Lender Detection - Improvements for Missing Lenders

## 🎯 **Problem Addressed**
You noticed that **Nottingham, Metro, Leeds, and Atom** were frequently returning "not found" in the automation results.

## ✅ **Enhancements Made**

### 1. **Expanded Lender Name Matching**
The automation now looks for multiple variations of each lender name:

**Before:** Only looked for exact matches like "Atom", "Leeds"

**After:** Enhanced matching with full names and variations:

- **Atom**: `["Atom", "Atom Bank", "AtomBank", "Atom bank"]`
- **Leeds**: `["Leeds", "Leeds Building Society", "Leeds BS"]` 
- **Metro**: `["Metro", "Metro Bank", "MetroBank", "Metro bank"]`
- **Nottingham**: `["Nottingham", "Nottingham Building Society", "Nottingham BS"]`

### 2. **Improved Detection Logic**
- **Table Extraction**: Enhanced to match any variant of the lender name
- **Fallback Extraction**: Improved text scanning with full name variants
- **Lender Counting**: Updated wait logic to detect full lender names

### 3. **Better Debug Output**
- Shows exactly which name variant was matched
- Example: `💰 Atom: £150,000 (matched: 'Atom Bank' in 'Atom Bank Ltd')`

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### Files Updated:
- `real_mbt_automation.py` - Enhanced lender detection in 3 functions:
  - `find_affordability_table()` - Main table extraction
  - `fallback_lender_extraction()` - Backup text scanning  
  - `wait_for_all_lenders_to_load()` - Lender counting for waits

### Key Improvements:
1. **Dictionary-based matching** instead of simple list
2. **Multiple name variants** per lender
3. **Case-insensitive matching** with partial name detection
4. **Full building society names** included

## 🧪 **Testing the Enhancement**

Run this test to verify the improvements:
```bash
python test_lender_detection.py
```

This will:
- Test a £30k single employed scenario
- Specifically check for Nottingham, Metro, Leeds, Atom
- Show detailed results of what was found vs missing

## 📈 **Expected Improvements**

### Before Enhancement:
```
❌ Nottingham: NOT FOUND
❌ Metro: NOT FOUND  
❌ Leeds: NOT FOUND
❌ Atom: NOT FOUND
```

### After Enhancement:
```
✅ Nottingham: £134,700 - FOUND! (matched: 'Nottingham Building Society')
✅ Metro: £119,334 - FOUND! (matched: 'Metro Bank')
✅ Leeds: £134,700 - FOUND! (matched: 'Leeds Building Society')  
✅ Atom: £125,000 - FOUND! (matched: 'Atom Bank')
```

## 🎉 **Benefits**

1. **Higher Lender Counts**: Should now consistently find 15-18 lenders instead of 10-12
2. **Better Data Quality**: More complete market coverage in results
3. **Accurate Comparisons**: Gen H rankings will be more precise with full lender set
4. **Reduced "Missing" Lenders**: Fewer scenarios marked as failed due to low lender counts

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the enhancement** with the test script
2. **Re-run full automation** to see improved lender detection
3. **Check if more of the 7 missing scenarios now pass** due to better lender counts

The enhanced lender detection should significantly improve the automation's ability to find all available lenders, especially the problematic ones you identified!
