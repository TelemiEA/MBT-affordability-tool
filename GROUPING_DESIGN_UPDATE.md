# 🎨 Grouped Design Update - Complete!

## ✅ What I've Implemented

### 1. **Server-Side Improvements**
- **Enhanced Grouping Logic**: Scenarios now sorted by income within each group
- **Income Extraction**: Automatically extracts income amounts (£20k, £30k, etc.) for proper sorting
- **Clear Group Headers**: Added descriptive headers with emojis and income ranges

### 2. **Frontend Visual Improvements**  
- **Color-Coded Groups**: Each scenario type has its own color theme
  - 🔵 **Sole Employed**: Blue (#4299e1)
  - 🟢 **Sole Self-Employed**: Green (#48bb78)  
  - 🟠 **Joint Employed**: Orange (#ed8936)
  - 🟣 **Joint Self-Employed**: Purple (#9f7aea)

- **Success/Failure Indicators**: Each scenario shows clear status
  - ✅ **SUCCESS**: 10+ lenders found with valid Gen H amount
  - ❌ **FAILED**: Fewer than 10 lenders or missing data

- **Improved Headers**: Beautiful group headers with scenario count and sorting info

### 3. **Organized Display Order** (Exactly as you requested)
1. **👤 Sole Employed Scenarios** (£20k - £200k)
2. **👤 Sole Self-Employed Scenarios** (£20k - £200k)  
3. **👥 Joint Employed Scenarios** (£40k - £200k total)
4. **👥 Joint Self-Employed Scenarios** (£40k - £200k total)

Each group is sorted by income level from lowest to highest.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When you refresh the dashboard:
1. **Server**: Automatically groups scenarios by type
2. **Server**: Sorts scenarios within each group by income amount
3. **Frontend**: Displays groups in the exact order you requested
4. **Frontend**: Shows clear success/failure status for each scenario
5. **Frontend**: Uses color coding to make groups easily distinguishable

## 🔍 What You'll See

### Group Headers:
```
👤 Sole Employed Scenarios (£20k - £200k)
   6 scenarios • Ordered by income level

👤 Sole Self-Employed Scenarios (£20k - £200k)  
   6 scenarios • Ordered by income level

👥 Joint Employed Scenarios (£40k - £200k total)
   6 scenarios • Ordered by income level

👥 Joint Self-Employed Scenarios (£40k - £200k total)
   7 scenarios • Ordered by income level
```

### Individual Scenarios:
```
✅ Sole applicant, employed, £30k SUCCESS    [Rank #3]
❌ Joint applicants, self-employed, £200k total FAILED    [Rank N/A]
```

## 🚀 To See the Changes

1. **Refresh your browser** on http://127.0.0.1:8001
